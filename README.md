# THIS PROJECT HAS YET TO BE RELEASED. PLEASE CHECK BACK SOON!

# Key Features
Providing large testing and demo data alongside your code package releases can
be a challenge for two reasons. First, code repositories have strict limits on
the sizes of files you can include. Second, you don't want your users to wait
forever for your cool package to install because of large files you've
included in the installation. If you're a python developer and have hit these
problems then <b><a href=https://github.com/mscaudill/datarig
target=_blank>DataRig</a></b> is for you.  DataRig allows you to programmatically
move data from several data repositories into local directories of your
package such as a testing or demos folder after installation of your package.
This allows your package to fetch the needed data just-in-time for your users.

# Installation
DataRig only requires the requests library making installation a breeze. To
install 


Contributions are what makes open-source fun and we would love for you to
